This document is intended for the instructor or students of the human-computer interface course CPEN 541 to learn and possibly reproduce the experimental setup and results. The document outlines in detail the research questions we are pursing, as well as the motivation. This document also describe the prototype and its experiments we developed to test our research questions along with our findings. Lastly, this document features the limitations as well as the future work (including what the prototype would ideally look like). 

Please also refer to our other submitted work, including our conference paper, demonstrative video, and presentation slides.
