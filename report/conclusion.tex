We presented FutureGazer, a WVC system that allows users to achieve multi-person eye-contact in teleconferencing. The results demonstrated that involving eye-contact can enrich interactive experiences and enhance engagement level and focus level. We hope this paper opens up new opportunities for interactive teleconferencing and inspires the HCI community to further explore eye-contact element to realize the highly interactive WVC experiences. Some future implementations inspired by our participants includes combining head model and eye model, enhancing avatar vividness, and adding better pupil animation for the head model. We hope that these insights and findings point to potential directions for designing more satisfactory WVC systems, which are actively redefining our digital social lives today.
