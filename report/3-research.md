# Research Questions and Scope

This motivated us to explore alternative ways to represent participants in WVC applications to increase engagement, interactivity, and attention. 

We are set out to build a prototype WVC application to study the perceived effects of eye-contact, gaze, and head orientation in a virtual 3D space to make up the missing aspects from in-person F2F interactions.
