\section{Future Work}

This section talks about the future work

- Testing a combination of eyes and heads
- Testing a large grid of eyes vs. Heads 
- Different combination of styles of eyes and heads

Explore how avatars can move in the space -- what if the avatars can scale based on attention, what if the avatars move back and forth (z direction) based on attention? What you can physically move around in the space

Improvement to the avatar models:

- head nodding
- breathing
- mouth shapes
- hand gestures
- improved randomization
- improved blinking

We would also like to see how this concept can extend to other fields:
- how we can incorporate ML and facial expression recognition technology
- reduce on internet bandwidth for less fortunate participants (lowers data usage)
-
