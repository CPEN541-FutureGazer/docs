\section*{Preface}

This document is intended for the instructor or students of the human-computer interface course CPEN 541 to learn and possibly reproduce the experimental setup and results. The document outlines in detail the research questions we are pursing, as well as the motivation. This document also describe the prototype and its experiments we developed to test our research questions along with our findings. Lastly, this document features the limitations as well as the future work (including what the prototype would ideally look like). 

Please also refer to our other submitted work, including our conference paper, demonstrative video, and presentation slides.

We can be contacted via our emails (listed at the top of the document). All the code for this project can be found on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/CPEN541-FutureGazer}.

\section{Introduction and Problem}

Over the last year, we all observed and experienced first-hand at attempting to scavenge the productivity and work-ethics we once had while working from home while in a pandemic. And one of the most important work-related ritual is none other than meetings and hangouts. 

As limited by the restriction and the isolation to curb the infectious virus, we sacrificed the ability to meet with people face-to-face (F2F) --- whether that be getting work done, attending classes, discussing and brainstorming ideas, and even asking for help and or assistance from peers. Out of necessity, we all forced to use online web-video-conferencing (WVC) software such as Zoom, Skype, etc. as a substitute.

Despite these companies touting the technological advancements, the intuitive of its user-interfaces, the affordable cost of “free” to its users, they all had this one *glaring* (pun-intended) problem that none of these software truly provided in the absence of F2F meetings: that \textbf{eye-contact} and \textbf{gaze} are an essential part of body language and non-verbal communications in social situations. 

Conventional WVC software evolved from 1-on-1 meetings, where the only other person on the screen is the one you talk to, like in a phone call. This has the few problems of modern, large meetings involving more people, since the other person’s face is the only thing you look at and thus easier to make eye-contact and attention.

However, seen in the image below, as we add more participants to the meeting, instead of being an intimate experience, we are often presented with a gallery, somewhat like a bookshelf view of all the participants. Each participant is placed in a uniform cell as part of a grid. One could describe it as a jail-cell, lacking in connection, organicity, and coherency. Furthermore, because everyone is looking at their own screen, towards their camera, we get a mostly static view of all the participants looking out of the screen on the receiving end. Somewhat akin to have a large audience all staring at you --- even if you’re one among them passively listening.
